These are my Advent of Code solutions in Node.js. Please refer to https://adventofcode.com/events for the corresponding puzzles.

## Caveats
Solutions prior to December 5th, 2024, were not made in this repository. They were scattered in a couple private repos. I have added their commit/edit date in a comment at the top.

Also, the solutions in this repository are organized by the date the puzzles were published on the website. The folder names do not necessarily mean I started/finished my solution on that day. For imported commits refer to the date at the top of the file, otherwise refer to the actual commit date.
### Incomplete solutions
For 2020, day 3, I found part 1 in a repo but it is self-described as unfinished, even though I have two stars for that day. For day 4 the same repo contains part 1 and 2, but those too appear to be broken, and I have no stars for that day. But my teacher has one, so that's probably how I saw part 2. I included those solutions as `2020/day3/legacypart1.js`, `2020/day4/legacypart1.js`, and `2020/day4/legacypart2.js`.

I'm not sure if I will or can come back to 2020 day 3 seeing as though I already have the stars, but I'll probably get to day 4 at some point.
